\section{Milestone Negotiation}

The group will negotiate the milestones for Week 9 and Week 10 (also Week 11) with the client as a further negotiation for the milestones that were proposed on Week 5. The milestones will cover three weeks' outcomes of the group including Week 9, Week 10, and Week 11 this time. Some milestones that were proposed on Week 5 will be modified here and the whole milestone plan will be a better time allocation balance for the completing of the whole project.

A supplementary document which contains the details of these milestones will be delivered to the client as a reference for the milestones.
