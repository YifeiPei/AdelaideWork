\subsection{Testing plan}
%%\includegraphics[scale=0.8] {Testing_Plan.pdf}
The testing approach for our project is using the bottom-up methodology. Each member of group 2 will be responsibility for their own tests. After finishing their own tests, they need to report to the test manager and then the test manager will carry out the system integration test. The responsibility of each member will be presented in the following part. The tool for testing is JUnit, which is used to check whether it has a bug in the whole program. The test will distribute into 3 levels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Functional Level
\item Integration Level
\item User Level
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Functional Testing:} Each member in group 2 will be assigned to a part of program, which contains a complete function in the robot. To ensure the quality of testing, each member must create sufficient white-box tests and report the test cases with test results to the test manager. It is recommended to swap the task of testing with other team members to let them test your code.
\\
\newline
\textbf{Component Test:} 
This test is to isolate the different components from each other to test and verify the correctness between components. The components are divided in following:
\\	
	\\-AI, responded by Matthew Nestor and Bowen Tao
	\\-GUI and Map Editor, responded by Yifei Pei and Jianqiu Li
	\\-Communication, responded by Abdulaziz Alhulayfi and Yu Hong
\\
\newline
\textbf{Integration Testing:}
The integration test is using bottom-up approach to test the correctness of the whole program. Simultaneously this test also should test whether it has exceptions and errors.  
\\
\newline
\textbf{Regression Test:} 
This test is to keep the system stable. After a bug is fixed, we must make sure that the original system function performs correctly. So a regression test is needed.
\\
\newline
\textbf{Stress Test:} 
It is used to test the robustness of the whole program when the data is flooding. Especially, in terms of the sensor receiver and communication, they should be tested thoroughly.
\\
\newline
\textbf{Final Test:} 
All the bugs which is found in the former tests will need to be fixed, to ensure that the whole program could run correctly.  

\subsection{Test Document}
Every group member will write a test report and submit to the test manager and a combined test report will be present in LaTex format.


\subsection{Quality Assurance Plan}

\item {Diagram 3: Quality Assurance plan}
\end{center}
Quality Assurance Plan provides a guide line for each developer to assess the deliverables' quality in each process. It handles the life cycle in development to satisfy the established SRS.    
\subsection{Verification \& Validation Process}
\subsubsection{One more thing}
The PMBOK guide is defined as follows in its 4th edition:
"Validation. The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers. Contrast with verification."\\
"Verification. The evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is often an internal process. Contrast with validation."

\section{Attachment: QA Check-list}
\subsection{Objective}

To check the quality of software development in different phases which contain the V\&V processes. This check-list will provide a intuitionistic feedback in terms of the software development, using by the score of the validation questions:\\

\subsection{Structure \& Assessment}

The document will be used to perform the checkout of quality, but considering the time allowed for the project, we will just hold the assessment twice.  
The first assessment date will be between the mid-break (21st Sep 2013 - 7th Oct 2013) and the second one will be held on Week 12 (28th Oct 2013 to 1 Nov 2013), which will be before the final presentation. Specific date will be negotiated by the group members within the period.\\
The evaluation way is defined: If Y is ticked then the marks will be increased by 1 whist N is ticked then the marks will be increased by 0. And if NA is ticked then the marks will be increased by -1.\\
The higher marks we get, the higher quality of the software development.
