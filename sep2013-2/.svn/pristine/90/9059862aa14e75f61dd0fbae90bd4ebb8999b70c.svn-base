\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document covers the specification of software requirements for developing the
SEP project in semester 2, 2013. The project objective is
to develop a Robot that is capable of marking road closures and identifying 
dangerous areas such that people are alerted not to move into these areas.
The software requirements specified in this document are collected from the clients.
This document is a part of the products to be maintained through the development of 
this project and needs to be delivered in conjunction with the other documents and products.
\\
\\
The scope of this document is the requirements that serves both the host program 
operation and the robot. The robot should be able to detect dangerous areas and send
 the information back to the host, and the operator at the host side is able to control the movement of the robot.
\subsection{Document Conventions}
The specification of the software requirements consists of functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements, and security requirements. Each requirement will be classified into High, Medium, or Low priority, which will be tagged in its corresponding requirement statement.
\subsection{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is intended for all stakeholders of the SEP project in 2013, which include lectures/clients, who are the users of the system, and all members of group two in this class, who are contributing to the project.\\
\\
The below sections contain the specification of software requirements which consist of functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements, and user requirements for both the robot and host systems, which are important information for the designers, developers and testers. Designers of the system need this information to design the architecture of the system, which is a key procedure before developers could start their work. Developers of the system also need these information to guide them implementing specific functions. Furthermore, testers need to test the specific functions of the system with accordance to these provided requirements.\\
\\
Since this document contains all the requirements that describe the functionalities of the system, it is recommended that this document should be thoroughly read.
\subsection{Project Scope}
The project scopes are to produce a prototype of the robot required in SEP project, and to deliver the corresponding documents according to the schedule.\\
\\
The robot should be able to identify and mark the road closures as well as dangerous areas in the map on both the robot and host side. To achieve this goal, a whiteboard marker would be mounted to the robot. Thus, whenever the robot marks on the map, the GUI (i.e., Graphical User Interface) on the host system would dynamically display the changes, with an XML (i.e., Extensible Markup Language) document being generated and updated simultaneously. In addition, the robot should be able to automatically conduct the map by means of all possible features detected.\\
\\
With regard to the documentation of this project, SRS, SDD, SPMP, and user manual will be created according to the schedule of the project and maintained through the process of developing phase.\\

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
This software product consists of major two components.\\
\\
The first one is to run on the robot, a pre-existing LEGO Mindstorms NXT, for detecting and marking dangerous areas in the city.
 The second is the one that resides in the host system, which is capable of controlling the activities of the robot and displaying the mapping information.\\
\\
Continuous communication is required between the robot and host system and is achieved by means of Bluetooth device.\\
\subsection{Product Features}
The product consists of two components: the robot side and host side.
The main features of the robot side includes:

\begin{itemize}


\item The robot should be able to explore a city area and identify dangerous areas autonomously. After the robot arrives at the initial starting position of the city area, it would start to explore and map the site without intervention from the operator. However, the operator is allowed to commence manual control when necessary.
\item The robot should be able to mark the dangerous areas, in the form of:\\
\\
A visual map constructed on paper/card;
\\
A visual representation in the map area of the GUI;
\\
textual representation XML file, which abide by the format specified by the DTD (i.e., Document Type Definition) file.
\item The robot should be able to stop autonomously for the sake of safety in the case of low battery level or losing communication with the host side.
\end{itemize}
The main features of the host side includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item The GUI (i.e., Graphical User Interface) on the computer allows the operator to manually control and monitor the robot's movement, which is achieved by a set of buttons and a map panel, respectively.
\item The operator is able to establish a communication with the robot by means of the GUI and Bluetooth device.
\item The operator is able to stop the movement of the robot using the emergency stop button in the GUI whenever an emergency occurs.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
Since programming techniques and technical know-how are not required, people from different fields are able to use this product after some basic training.
\\
In general, users can be classified into the following three groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item Trainer and Trainee
\\
For educational purposes, trainees can be motivated to create their own products for similar or distinguished critical tasks, after this product is demonstrated by the trainers.
\item Military
\\
As some areas might be dangerous, Military can use this product to explore and map the area with no human being exposed, which would be more efficient and accurate than manually mapping by humans.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Operating Environment}
The application will be installed on a pre-built Lego Mindstorms NXT robot, which has 256 Kbytes Flash and 64 Kbytes Ram on the leJOS 0.9.1 pre-flashed firmware.



\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
The design and implementation constraints originate from the pre-built robot hardware and client requirements. These constraints are listed as follows:%put in list formatting
\begin{itemize}
\item Hardware constraint. The Lego Robot has only 256 Kbytes to store the instructions, which is a restriction to development of the artificial intelligence of the robot.
\item Programming language constraint. The system must be implemented in Java.
\item The mapping data must be saved in the XML file abiding by the format defined in DTD.
\item The tool 'make' must be used to build any version of the software.
\item The software should be tested in JUnit.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Documentation}

\begin{itemize}
\item API Documentation. The source code of the software will be documented in Javadoc to hyperlink related documents together, which would generate an API (i.e., Application Programming Interface) documentation in HTML format. This API Documentation would facilitate the developers and maintainers to maintain the source code.
\item User Manual. The user of the software will be provided with a User Manual, which contains the guide to the use of GUI and control of the robot.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
\item The communication between the robot and host computer is achieved by Bluetooth device, which has a maximum range of approximately 100 meters. We assume that the robot and the host computer would always be within this range during the mapping process.
\item We assume that the operator is able to monitor the movement of the robot clearly while it is mapping.
\end{itemize}
