\section{Time and Place}
The fourth client meeting for Software Engineering and Project was held in \textbf{Ingkarni
Wardli, Room 462 \textnormal{at} 2:30pm \textnormal{on} Monday 2 September 2013}.
\section{Quorum Announcement}
Having established that all members were present, the meeting was declared open.
\section{Summary of Previous Meeting}
Mr.~JianQui Li presented the group milestone, the SRS document draft. The document covered both functional and non-functional
requirements, automatic and manual modes of operation, user requirements, system features, and external inferface requirements.
Mr.~Yifei Pei gave a presentation of his individual milestone, the GUI mockup. Features of the GUI included an area to display
the map; buttons for robot manual control; dangerous zone editing; buttons for map loading and saving; an area for robot
status feedback to be displayed; robot representation; and battery life and bluetooth signal representations. Lastly, the
milestones for weeks 9 and 10 were negotiated.
\section{Group Milestone: Robot movement}
\subsection{Overview}
Mr.~Nestor presented the new robot design and movement capabilities.
\subsection{Detailed Presentation}
Mr.~Nestor presented the new and fifth incarnation of the robot design. The new model was slightly 
wider than previous versions, with all motors side by side at the base. Two motors govern the robot's movement, and one motor
governs the pen mechanism. Unlike previous versions, the pen mechanism is located at the back of the robot, and all sensors are
located at the front. The bump sensors are joined by a lego strip so that the robot will be able to infer roughly where an object is
based on what part of the strip is touched.

Mr.~Nestor uploaded a simple program to the robot to demonstrate basic motor functionality. The program was a routine:
first the robot moved forward 50cm, then backward 50cm, then it rotated 90 degrees clockwise and back again, then 90 degrees
anticlockwise and back again. Finally, it turned 180 degrees clockwise, lowered the pen mechanism, rotated slightly to draw,
then raised the pen.

\section{Individual Milestone Reports}
No individual milestones were reported.

\section{Risk Management: Risk Scenario Analysis}
The group conducted a risk analysis of the scenario provided. Mr.~Nestor was picked at random to give the presentation. The group
identified six risk types: technology, tools, people, requirements, organisation, and estimation. These types were expanded upon
and then applied to the specific scenario. The scenario specific risks identified were language barriers, cultural barriers,
hospitality failures, and tough deadlines. Tables for risk effects and probabilities were provided for general and scenario-specific
risks. Please refer to the attached slides for copies of the tables.

\section{Project Administration}
In the previous meeting, the group was instructed to refine their milestones to be more precise and easy to test. Thus, Mr.~Pei
prepared and gave the client the necessary supplimentary milestone documentation.

\section{Meeting Feedback}
\begin{itemize}
 \item The client was very happy with the robot presentation and the meeting generally
 \item The lecturer gave the group the marked SRS document draft, for which the group was awarded 51\%. The lecturer assured the
 group that this was a reasonable mark for a first draft. He noted that specific queries regarding the marking of the SRS draft
 should be directed to the marker, Chris Johnson. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Adjournment}
The next meeting is a group meeting to be held in Ingkarni
Wardli, Room 462 at 2pm on Thursday 5 September 2013.\\
The meeting closed at 2:56pm.
