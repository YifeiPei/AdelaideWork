Previous Assignment Code from the courses in the University of Adelaide

It is a pity that I cannot find the codes I wrote for Evolutionary Computation. They were stored in a different
SVN repository in my University Account, so I did not download that repository into my computer.
Now it is impossible to retrieve that repository as all my University Account details have been deleted.
